                        <div class="blog-content">
                        
<p style="text-align:justify"><img alt="" src="http://www.adu.ac.ae/Portals/0/AduImage/selection_process_banner.jpg" style="float:right; height:205px; margin:5px; width:300px" />We don't rely on third parties for supply of potential candidates. Every day hundreds of youth come to our company, while many send their bio-data and work experience through our website and e-mail for overseas employment, drawn by the reputation of the quality service we provide. Every information of these candidates are entered into our virtual databank by our recruitment officers in “Employment Opportunity Service Desk”. At present, we have thousands of such CVs in our Databank stored.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Each potential candidate must face preliminary interview with our recruitment officers before the final selection. We use two interview techniques for the selection of short-listed candidates.</p>

<p>1) <strong>Video Call:</strong> This technique is for those who are too busy to come to Nepal for interviewing the can-didates selected in preliminary section. We make every arrangement for the interview between em-ployers and the employee through video call.<br>
2) <strong>Final Interview:</strong> Many employers visit Nepal for final interview. We make all necessary preparations for interview. We call shortlisted candidates for the particular day. We have fully equipped AC rooms and other modern facilities - computers, telephones, Internet, and all that an interviewer might need.<br>
3) <strong>On the behalf of the employer:</strong> Sometimes, manpower importing agencies give full authority to us for entire selection procedures. In such case, we carry out interviews on behalf of employers abroad and make all dispatching arrangements to the employment destination.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">If special manpower with specific experience is needed, we use our official network located in different districts to headhunt such individual. Headhunting does not limit only in the domestic market for sup-plying the need of highly professional manpower. The discipline level of each and every worker is tested so as to avoid possible risks from the workers abroad. We examine the workers morality, attitude, behavior and personal history. Team of our experts including a psychiatrist carries out these tests. Candidates have to go through medical tests after final selection. Only medically fit candidates are eligible to sign an agreement or contract paper.</p>
